Einstein's most famous work is his theory of general relativity, which explains the relationship between space, time, and mass-energy. He also developed the theory of quantum mechanics, which explains the behavior of subatomic particles. Einstein's work on cosmology, particularly his theory of the Big Bang, has also had a significant impact on our understanding of the universe.\n",
